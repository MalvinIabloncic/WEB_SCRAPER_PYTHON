# WEB_SCRAPER_PYTHON

WHY IS THIS PROGRAM USEFUL?

A user can get all the prices of a product he needs in just a few of seconds instead of searching for the product by himself.


WHAT IT DOES?

*It opens a URL specified by the user, prints the title and the meta description and it also prints the URL into a .ini file. 
  
*It prints the title and the price of all OLX announcements containing the keyword "iphone 14 pro max", in ascending order by price.
  
*If the "python <filename> -log info" command is written in the terminal the program also prints the time it takes for each request.
  
*It sends an email to "an.email@gmail.com" if the price of a specific item gets reduced under a target price.
